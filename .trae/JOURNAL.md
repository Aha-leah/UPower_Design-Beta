## 🌟 Highlights

### [2026-01-29 18:15] 💡 User Validation of "Lab-Clean" Aesthetic
*   **Trigger**: User Praise ("首屏风格我满意")
*   **Context**: The user validated the "Hero" section's implementation of the "Lab-Clean Brutalism" style defined in the System Prompt. This confirms the "No Shadow / High Contrast" direction is correct.
*   **Quote**: "首屏风格我满意" (I am satisfied with the hero screen style)

### [2026-01-29 18:00] 💡 Self-Documenting System Implemented
*   **Trigger**: System Event (Major Milestone)
*   **Context**: Implemented `scribe_automation.md` rule and `knowledge-scribe` integration to enable the system to automatically record "Aha!" moments and user praise without manual intervention.
*   **Quote**: "如果我沟通中不自觉表示了赞叹或者agent自动识别到了重大变更。就自动记录" (User request for automation)

### [2026-01-30 11:51] 💡 The "Anti-Memory" Principle (Tier 3 Architecture)
*   **Trigger**: User Insight / Architectural Pivot
*   **Context**: Moving from memory-based data consistency to physical symlinks (`scaffold_project.js` refactor). User emphasized that critical workflows must be rigorous and independent of AI context window limits.
*   **Quote**: "有些工作趴不能依赖上下文记忆，不严谨" (Some workflows cannot rely on context memory; it's not rigorous enough)

### [2026-01-30 14:02] 💡 Team Snapshot Frozen (v1.0.0 Stable)
*   **Trigger**: User Approval / System Event
*   **Context**: The team configuration (Alice, Bob, Biubiu) achieved a 98/100 audit score on the "Brutalism" style. User requested to "freeze" this state like a Git tag for future reuse.
*   **Quote**: "我支持，freeze有点git的方式来维护我的团队升级，对吧"

### [2026-01-30 14:15] 💡 Team Upgrade: The Visual Bridge (v1.1.0)
*   **Trigger**: Capability Upgrade
*   **Context**: Upgraded **Bob (Visual Designer)** with MCP integration. He can now directly "bridge" with Figma to extract data/assets and use Generative AI (Flux) to create missing visuals.
*   **Quote**: "需要更新团队版本" (Need to update team version)

### [2026-02-03] 💡 Language Policy Enforced
*   **Trigger**: Core Rule Modification
*   **Context**: Added `.trae/rules/language_policy.md` to mandate Simplified Chinese as the primary output language for all AI interactions and documentation.
*   **Quote**: "增加一个rules，输出要求中文"
